  <h4>Travelling in Depression</h4>

  When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
  me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
  given me a unique learning experience.
  <p>At five, I <img src="girl.jpeg" style="float: left; margin:5px; width="200px"; height="400px";"> <a href="">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Towe</a> r in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the
  heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways
  on sleeka.  gondolas. At ;thirteen,&I saw the ancient, megalithi;structure of Stonehenge and
  walked along <a href=""></a> Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old  
  
  stones were still in place just as it is in
<a href="https://starzit.com/">Starz University</a>
 <p> It was through exploring cultures the world that I first
  became interested in language.</p>
<p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of
  pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
  where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
  the A, she looked at me bewildered</p>
  
 <p> In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
  aware of its similarities with English through cognates.""
  Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
  different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
  me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
  come to the rescue when I &nbspforget how to say something in Spanish<br><a href="gmail://nimelyacts765@gmail.com/"> Send Us Email</a>
  Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
  school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost.</p>
<p>  I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
  fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
  volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
  and rhythm as I form them.
